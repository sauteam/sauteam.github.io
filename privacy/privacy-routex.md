# Privacy Policy for RouteX

**Last Updated: February 4, 2026**

This Privacy Policy explains how **RouteX** ("we," "our," or "the App") collects, uses, and protects your information. RouteX is committed to protecting your privacy while providing a seamless experience for recording your positions and light-chasing moments.

------

### 1. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

To provide our core features, RouteX requires access to the following data:

#### **A. Location Data**

- **Purpose:** RouteX automatically records your position to calculate and capture "light-chasing moments" (such as sunset, sunrise, or specific astronomical events) based on your coordinates.
- **Access Level:** We may request **"Always Allow"** or **"While In Use"** location permissions. The "Always Allow" permission is necessary for the App to record your path or trigger alerts even when the App is running in the background.
- **Storage:** All precise location coordinates and history are stored **locally on your device**. We do not upload your real-time trajectory to our servers.

#### **B. Notifications**

- **Purpose:** We use local and push notifications to alert you of upcoming light-chasing moments, record status updates, or system reminders.
- **Control:** You can opt-out of notifications at any time through your device settings.

------

### 2. DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY

- **Local-First Privacy:** RouteX is designed with a "Local-First" philosophy. Your sensitive location history remains under your control on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch.
- **No Third-Party Sharing:** We **do not sell, trade, or rent** your location data or personal information to third-party advertisers or data brokers.
- **Data Retention:** You have the right to delete your location history within the App. Once deleted, this data is permanently removed from your device.

------

### 3. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

We may use limited third-party SDKs for the following purposes:

- **Map Services:** To display your recorded positions (e.g., Apple Maps).
- **Crash Reporting:** To collect anonymous technical logs (device model, iOS version) to fix bugs and improve stability. These logs do not contain your name or precise location coordinates.

------

### 4. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

RouteX does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 16+. If you are a parent or guardian and realize your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.

------

### 5. YOUR CHOICES AND RIGHTS

You have full control over your data through the iOS System Settings:

1. **Location:** You can change or revoke location permissions at **Settings > Privacy > Location Services > RouteX**.
2. **Notifications:** You can manage alert styles at **Settings > Notifications > RouteX**.

------

### 6. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
